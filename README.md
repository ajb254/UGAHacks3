# UGAHacks3
Jupyter Notebook from my 8-hour attempt at uncovering anomalies for the Aspirent Uber Data Analytics Challenge. This was my winning submission!

The dataset gives you very little to work with in terms of features, but I managed produce some cool insights.

# Challenge
*Hackers, we want you to work with Uber’s ride data. This dataset must be used. This challenge is intended to be a very open ended challenge. We want you to explore the Uber ride data set and come up with new trends or find anomalies. You’re allowed to use other datasets to supplement this analysis. We’ve added some additional resources for datasets that you can use, but you’re not limited to only these resources. You can supplement it with whatever datasets that you find! After you finish your analysis, we want you to visualize it. Show us what you’ve found.*
